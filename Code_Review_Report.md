# CHTL Code Review Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive review of the CHTL codebase against the specifications outlined in `CHTL.md`.

The project has a solid architectural foundation, with a well-organized directory structure and a robust `CMake` build system that correctly handles third-party dependencies. The core language features required to parse and generate basic, static HTML structures are **implemented** and covered by unit tests.

However, the vast majority of advanced features that define CHTL's unique value proposition are either **unimplemented, non-functional, or only partially complete**. This includes, but is not limited to, advanced CSS integration (e.g., property arithmetic), template inheritance, module usage, and the entire CHTL JS subsystem. The sophisticated multi-compiler pipeline described in the specification exists only in concept; in practice, the compiler operates as a single, monolithic parser.

The project is currently at an **early alpha stage**. The groundwork is laid, but significant development is required to achieve the vision described in the specification.

## 2. Detailed Audit by Section

This audit follows the structure of the `CHTL.md` specification.

### 2.1. Core Syntax & Elements

*   **Status:** **Mostly Implemented**
*   **Details:**
    *   **Comments (`//`, `/**/`, `#`):** **Implemented.** The lexer correctly identifies and handles all three comment types.
    *   **Text Nodes (`text {}`, `text: "..."`):** **Implemented.** Both the block and attribute forms are parsed correctly into text nodes.
    *   **Literals (unquoted, single/double quotes):** **Implemented.**
    *   **CE Equality (`:` vs `=`):** **Implemented** for element attributes.
    *   **Element Nodes:** **Implemented.** Basic parsing of nested elements and attributes is functional.

### 2.2. Local Style Blocks (`style {}`)

*   **Status:** **Critically Incomplete**
*   **Details:**
    *   **Inline Styles:** **Implemented.** Basic CSS key-value pairs are parsed and stored.
    *   **Automated Class/ID Selectors:** **Not Implemented.** Placeholder functions exist but are unused.
    *   **Contextual Inference (`&`):** **Not Implemented.**
    *   **Property Arithmetic:** **Not Implemented.**
    *   **Referenced Properties:** **Not Implemented.**
    *   **Property Conditional Expressions:** **Not Implemented.**
    *   **Conclusion:** Only the most basic function of a style block is present. None of the advanced, productivity-enhancing features are functional.

### 2.3. Templates (`[Template]`)

*   **Status:** **Partially Implemented**
*   **Details:**
    *   **Definition (`@Style`, `@Element`, `@Var`):** **Implemented.** The parser correctly defines all three template types and stores them in the `TemplateManager`.
    *   **Usage (`@Style`, `@Element`):** **Implemented.** Style and Element templates can be successfully applied.
    *   **Usage (`@Var`):** **Not Implemented.** The value parser does not handle variable template lookups.
    *   **Inheritance (Composition & `inherit`):** **Not Implemented.**

### 2.4. Customization (`[Custom]`)

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**
*   **Details:**
    *   The `[Custom]` keyword is parsed and flagged on template nodes, but this flag is never used. All specialization features (`delete`, parameterless properties, element specialization via blocks, etc.) are missing from the parser and generator.
    *   **Conclusion:** `[Custom]` blocks are functionally identical to `[Template]` blocks.

### 2.5. Raw Embedding (`[Origin]`)

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**
*   **Details:** The parser contains a non-functional stub for `[Origin]` blocks. It consumes the tokens but discards the content, making the feature unusable.

### 2.6. Imports (`[Import]`)

*   **Status:** **Partially Implemented**
*   **Details:**
    *   **CHTL File Import:** **Partially Implemented.** The compiler can import a `.chtl` file and merge its templates.
    *   **Path Resolution:** **Partially Implemented.** The `ModuleResolver` searches the local directory and a `modules/` subdirectory. It does not support official module paths or `.`/`/` equivalence.
    *   **Non-CHTL, Selective, and Wildcard Imports:** **Not Implemented.**
    *   **`.cmod` Module Usage:** **Not Implemented.** The loader cannot read from zip archives.

### 2.7. Namespaces (`[Namespace]`)

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**
*   **Details:** The `[Namespace]` definition logic is a non-functional stub. While the `TemplateManager` is namespace-aware, the inability to define new namespaces makes the feature unusable as specified. The `from` keyword is parsed but has limited utility.

### 2.8. Constraints (`except`)

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**
*   **Details:** Constraints are parsed and stored in the AST, but they are never checked or enforced by the generator. The feature is non-functional.

### 2.9. Configuration (`[Configuration]` & `use`)

*   **Status:** **Partially Implemented**
*   **Details:**
    *   **Parsing:** **Implemented.** Parsing of several flags, the `[Name]` block for keyword aliasing, and named configs is functional.
    *   **Usage (`use`):** **Implemented.** `use html5;` and `use @Config <name>;` both work as specified.
    *   **Missing Flags:** Many configuration flags mentioned in the spec are not recognized by the parser.

### 2.10. CHTL JS

*   **Status:** **Critically Incomplete**
*   **Details:**
    *   **Local `script` Blocks:** **Not Implemented.** The CHTL parser does not recognize `script {}` blocks, making it impossible to use CHTL JS from within a `.chtl` file. This is the single largest gap in the current implementation, as it prevents any interaction between the two languages.
    *   **Standalone Compiler:** **Partially Implemented.** The `src/CHTL_JS` directory contains a well-structured set of nodes and files for a standalone CHTL JS compiler, but this is completely disconnected from the main CHTL pipeline.

### 2.11. Modules (CMOD & CJMOD)

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**
*   **Details:**
    *   **CMOD:** A packer utility exists to create basic `.cmod` archives, but the compiler cannot read them. Advanced features like `[Export]` block generation are missing.
    *   **CJMOD:** The entire CJMOD system is absent.

### 2.12. Project & Build

*   **Status:** **Good**
*   **Details:**
    *   **Project Structure:** The codebase is well-organized and easy to navigate.
    *   **Build System:** The `CMakeLists.txt` file is robust and correctly manages dependencies.
    *   **Compiler Pipeline:** **Not Implemented.** The `UnifiedScanner`, `CompilerDispatcher`, and `CodeMerger` are non-functional, orphaned components. The project operates as a monolithic parser, not the sophisticated pipeline described in the spec. The integrations with `libsass` and `quickjs` are not used in the main compilation flow.

### 2.13. Testing

*   **Status:** **Fair**
*   **Details:** A testing framework is in place and successfully validates the implemented core features. However, test coverage is low and does not include any of the unimplemented advanced features. The presence of integration test files is a positive sign for future development.

## 3. Conclusion & Recommendations

The CHTL project has a promising but incomplete foundation. The immediate priority should be to bridge the gap between the specification and the implementation. A recommended path forward is outlined in the `Development_Roadmap.md` document.
