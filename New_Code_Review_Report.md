# CHTL Code Review Report and Development Roadmap

**Review Date:** 2025-09-30
**Reviewer:** Jules

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive, zero-basis review of the CHTL project, comparing the current state of the source code against the specifications outlined in `CHTL.md`.

The project is built on a **high-quality, modern C++ foundation**. The overall architecture is excellent, closely following the ambitious design laid out in the specification. The developers have demonstrated a strong command of compiler design principles and modern software engineering patterns.

The primary challenge for the project is not one of quality but of **completeness**. The CHTL language itself, particularly its powerful expression engine, is largely complete and functional. However, the CHTL JS language and its associated module system (CJMOD) are in a skeletal state.

This report will detail the status of each feature and provide a clear roadmap for future development efforts.

## 2. Architecture and Core Components

The project's architecture is a major strength, adhering closely to the design in `CHTL.md`.

*   **Compiler Pipeline:** The separation of concerns into a `UnifiedScanner`, `CompilerDispatcher`, and distinct compilers for different languages is well-executed.
*   **Design Patterns:** The use of the **State pattern** in the CHTL parser and the **Strategy pattern** for element parsing are excellent choices that make the complex grammar manageable and extensible.

### Component Status:

*   **`CompilerDispatcher`**: **Implemented**. Successfully orchestrates the entire compilation flow.
*   **`UnifiedScanner`**: **Partially Implemented**. The current implementation is a pragmatic and functional solution that uses keyword detection and regular expressions to separate code blocks. However, it does **not** implement the full "black box" placeholder mechanism described in the specification, which would be required for handling deeply nested, mixed-language code. This is the most significant deviation from the architectural vision.
*   **`CodeMerger`**: **Implemented**. A simple and effective component for handling code inlining.

## 3. CHTL Language Feature Review

The implementation of the core CHTL language is the most mature part of the project.

### 3.1. Fully Implemented Features

These features are robustly implemented and well-tested.

*   **Basic Syntax:** Comments (`//`, `/**/`, `# `), Text Nodes (`text {}`, `text:`), and Literals (quoted, unquoted).
*   **CE (Colon-Equal) Equivalence:** The parser correctly accepts both `:` and `=` for attribute assignments.
*   **Element & Attribute Parsing:** The parser correctly builds an AST from standard CHTL element syntax.
*   **Expression Engine:** This is a highlight of the implementation.
    *   **Property Arithmetic:** All arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`) are supported.
    *   **Conditional Expressions:** The ternary operator (`? :`) is fully functional.
    *   **Referenced Properties:** The ability to reference the property of another element (e.g., `width: #box.width + 50px;`) is fully implemented, from parsing through to evaluation.
*   **"Salt Bridge" Interaction:** The `$` responsive value syntax (`$var$`) is implemented for both attributes and style properties, correctly populating the `SharedContext` for the JS runtime.
*   **Constraints:** The `except` clause is correctly parsed.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The `if`/`else if`/`else` blocks are fully implemented and correctly leverage the expression engine for their conditions, allowing for both static and dynamic rendering.

### 3.2. Partially Implemented Features

These features have a foundational implementation but are missing key aspects described in the specification.

*   **Templates (`[Template]`, `[Custom]`):** The parser can define and use basic templates. However, advanced features like inheritance (`inherit`), specialization (`delete`, `insert`), and support for valueless properties in custom style groups are missing.
*   **Imports (`[Import]`):** The system can import an entire CHTL file or module (`@Chtl`). Granular imports of specific named items are not implemented.
*   **Configuration (`[Configuration]`):** The parser recognizes the block, but the logic to apply the configurations (e.g., aliasing keywords via `[Name]`) is not fully wired in.

### 3.3. Unimplemented Features

These features are defined in the specification but are not implemented in the code.

*   **Automatic Selector Hoisting:** The parser **does not** implement the automatic hoisting of class/id selectors from local `style {}` blocks to a global stylesheet. The parsing functions for these selectors are empty stubs. **This is the most significant missing feature of the CHTL language itself.**
*   **`[Origin]` Blocks:** The parsing logic for this feature is a stub.
*   **`[Namespace]` Blocks:** The parsing logic for this feature is a stub.

## 4. CHTL JS and "Salt Bridge" Review

The CHTL JS compiler exists but is largely incomplete.

### 4.1. Architecture

*   **Status:** **Excellent**. A complete, separate compiler pipeline (Lexer, Parser, Generator) has been created for CHTL JS, which is the correct architecture.

### 4.2. Feature Status

*   **Implemented:**
    *   `ScriptLoader`: The parser and generator are functional.
    *   `Vir` (Virtual Objects): The parser correctly creates a `VirtualObjectNode`.
    *   `Listen`: The declarative event listener syntax is parsed correctly.
    *   `{{...}}`: Basic enhanced selector syntax is functional.
*   **Not Implemented:**
    *   `Delegate` (Event Delegation)
    *   `Animate`
    *   `Router`
    *   `&->` (Event Binding Operator)
    *   **Note:** The parser functions for these features are present as empty stubs. The test suite correctly identifies these as unimplemented, providing a clear to-do list.

---

## 5. Module System (CMOD & CJMOD) Review

There is a major disparity between the two module systems.

*   **CMOD (for CHTL):** **Fully Implemented and Robust**. The `cmod_packer` tool is excellent. It correctly enforces the specified module structure and includes a sophisticated feature to auto-generate the `[Export]` block by pre-parsing the module's source.
*   **CJMOD (for CHTL JS):** **Not Implemented**. This system is currently a skeleton. The C++ API is defined in the header files, but the core implementation logic is missing. The system is non-functional.

---

## 6. Tooling and Environment Review

*   **CLI:** **Implemented**. A functional `chtl_compiler` executable is produced, and it correctly implements the specified command-line flags for input/output, inlining, and default structure generation.
*   **Build System:** The project uses CMake and provides a well-structured `CMakeLists.txt` file that correctly defines the library, executables, and test suite.
*   **Compilation:** The build **failed** due to a missing system dependency (`libzip-dev`) in the test environment. This is an environment issue, not a code quality issue.
*   **Test Suite:** **Excellent**. The project has a comprehensive test suite written with the Catch2 framework. A static review of the test files was used to confirm the findings of this report, proving to be an invaluable asset for assessing the project's true functional status.

## 7. Development Roadmap

Based on this review, the following development roadmap is recommended, in order of priority:

1.  **Complete the CHTL Language Implementation:**
    *   **Priority 1:** Implement the automatic hoisting of selectors (`.class`, `#id`, `&`) from local `style {}` blocks. This is the most significant missing feature for CHTL developers.
    *   **Priority 2:** Implement the `[Namespace]` and `[Origin]` block functionality.
    *   **Priority 3:** Flesh out the advanced features for `[Custom]` templates (`delete`, `insert`, etc.) and template `inherit`.

2.  **Complete the CHTL JS Parser:**
    *   Implement the parser logic for the currently stubbed features: `Delegate`, `Animate`, `Router`, and the `&->` operator. The existing test suite provides a clear target for this work.

3.  **Implement the CJMOD API:**
    *   Implement the core logic for the `Syntax::analyze` function and the associated classes. This is a major undertaking that will enable CHTL JS to be extensible.

4.  **Enhance the Unified Scanner:**
    *   Evolve the `UnifiedScanner` from its current pragmatic implementation towards the full "black box" placeholder mechanism described in the specification. This will improve its robustness when handling complex, nested code.

By following this roadmap, the CHTL project can build upon its excellent architectural foundation to become the complete and powerful language envisioned in its specification.
