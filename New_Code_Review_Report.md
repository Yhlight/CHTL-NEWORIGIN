# CHTL Project: Comprehensive Review and Development Roadmap

## 1. Overall Assessment

The CHTL project is an ambitious undertaking with a remarkably detailed and well-thought-out specification (`CHTL.md`). The codebase reflects this ambition with a strong architectural foundation that aligns with the specification's recommendations, particularly the use of a state-machine parser and distinct components for different language features.

However, the project is in a highly developmental state where the implementation depth is inconsistent. While some components (like the CMOD packer) are surprisingly mature, the most critical enabling technologies are either incomplete or fundamentally misaligned with the specification.

The single greatest issue preventing progress is the **critical failure of the Unified Scanner**. This component does not function as specified, which creates a cascading failure that blocks the implementation and testing of almost all advanced CHTL and CHTL JS features.

This report provides a detailed breakdown of the current state and a prioritized roadmap to guide future development.

## 2. Build System and Dependencies

A major discrepancy exists between the project's documented setup and its build configuration.

*   **Finding:** The `CMakeLists.txt` file is configured to link against pre-built static libraries (`libzippp_static.a`, `libsass.a`, `libqjs.a`) located in the `third-party/prebuilt` directory.
*   **Discrepancy:** The initial setup instructions involved cloning the source code for these dependencies into `third-party/`. The build system, as it stands, **does not compile these dependencies from source**.
*   **Recommendation:** A definitive dependency management strategy must be chosen.
    *   **Option A (Stick with Pre-built - Recommended for Simplicity):** Remove the cloned source directories (`third-party/libzippp`, etc.) to avoid confusion. Document the exact versions and build configurations required to produce the pre-compiled libraries.
    *   **Option B (Build from Source):** Integrate the cloned libraries into the main CMake build using `add_subdirectory()`. This is more complex but gives full control over the build process and aligns with the user's request to "isolate third-party libraries."

## 3. CHTL Core Compiler: Feature Gap Analysis

The core CHTL parser is well-structured but has significant feature gaps.

### 3.1. Strengths (Well-Implemented Features)

*   **Core Parser Architecture:** The state-machine pattern (`ParserState`) is a solid, extensible foundation.
*   **Basic Syntax:** Standard elements, attributes (`:` and `=`), the `text: "..."` shorthand, and `#` comments are correctly parsed.
*   **Expression Parsing:** The delegation of complex style values (e.g., `width: 100px + 50px`) to a dedicated `ExpressionParser` that builds an AST is an excellent and robust design.
*   **Responsive Values (`$var$`):** The parsing and registration of responsive values for both attributes and style properties is functional.
*   **Constraints (`except`):** The `except` keyword is correctly parsed, and its various forms are recognized.

### 3.2. Gaps (Partially Implemented or Missing Features)

*   **Local Style Block Selectors (Critical Gap):** The ability to define `.class`, `#id`, and `&` rules inside a local `style` block to be hoisted to a global stylesheet is **non-functional**. The parsing functions (`parseClassOrIdSelector`, etc.) are empty stubs. This is one of the most powerful specified features, and its absence is a major gap.
*   **Advanced Templates & Customization (Critical Gap):** While basic template definition and usage is implemented, the advanced features that provide real power and flexibility are missing:
    *   Template inheritance (e.g., `@Style OtherTemplate;` inside a definition).
    *   Template specialization (the block after a template usage, e.g., `@Element Box { delete div[0]; }`).
    *   Valueless style groups in `[Custom] @Style`.
*   **Granular Imports:** The powerful, specific import syntax (e.g., `[Import] [Custom] @Element Box from ...`, wildcard imports) is not implemented. The current system only supports file-level `@Chtl` and `@CJmod` imports.
*   **Key Directives as Stubs:** The parsing functions for `[Origin]`, `[Namespace]`, and `[Export]` are stubs that consume tokens but do not implement the specified functionality.

## 4. Advanced Ecosystem: CHTL JS and Modules

The state of the advanced ecosystem components is highly varied.

### 4.1. CMOD Packer (Strength)

*   The `cmod_packer` utility is the most complete and well-implemented component in the entire project. It correctly validates the `src/` and `info/` module structure, uses the core parser to analyze all source files, and—most impressively—**automatically generates the `[Export]` block** based on the templates it finds. This is a production-ready tool.

### 4.2. CHTL JS Parser (Incomplete)

*   The parser has a decent foundation and correctly recognizes the keywords for most CHTL JS features (`Listen`, `Animate`, `Router`, `Vir`, etc.).
*   However, the implementation is **mostly stubs**. Only `ScriptLoader`, `Listen`, and `Vir` have basic parsing logic. `Animate`, `Router`, `Delegate`, and the event binding operator (`&->`) are completely unimplemented.
*   Its fundamental design, which expects a single `RawJavaScript` token for callbacks, is a critical flaw that prevents it from handling nested CHTL JS syntax. This is a direct consequence of the scanner's failure.

### 4.3. Unified Scanner (Critical Failure)

*   This component is the project's **most significant roadblock and requires a complete rewrite**.
*   **Architectural Mismatch:** The implementation does not function as the initial, global source code separator described in `CHTL.md`. It is a limited tool that only looks for `style` and `script` keywords, rather than processing the entire file first.
*   **Failed Placeholder Mechanism:** It **does not implement the recursive "black box" placeholder system**. It extracts the *entire* content of a script block and classifies the whole thing as either `JS` or `CHTL_JS`. It fails to parse the content to replace standard JS constructs (like `function() { ... }` or `if() {}`) with placeholders.
*   **Impact:** Without a functional Unified Scanner, the core premise of CHTL—the seamless integration of multiple languages—is unachievable. The CHTL JS parser and the advanced CSS features are completely blocked by its failure.

## 5. Recommended Development Roadmap

This roadmap prioritizes fixing foundational issues before implementing new features.

*   **P0: Decide on Dependency Management Strategy:**
    1.  Choose between using pre-built libraries or building from source via CMake's `add_subdirectory()`.
    2.  Update the `CMakeLists.txt` and repository structure accordingly. This must be done before any other development to ensure a stable build environment.

*   **P1: Re-architect and Implement the Unified Scanner (Highest Priority):**
    1.  Rewrite the scanner from scratch to match the architecture specified in `CHTL.md`. It must be the first step in the compilation pipeline, processing the entire raw source file.
    2.  Implement the recursive placeholder mechanism to correctly isolate CHTL JS from standard JS constructs (`function`, `if`, `for`, etc.) within script blocks.
    3.  Implement comprehensive scanning for *all* specified CHTL features within global `style` blocks (conditionals, variables, etc.), not just templates and basic arithmetic.

*   **P2: Complete Core CHTL Features:**
    1.  With the scanner providing clean CSS, implement the local style block selectors (`.class`, `#id`, `&`) and the logic to hoist them to a global stylesheet.
    2.  Implement the advanced template and customization features (`inherit`, `delete`, `insert`).
    3.  Flesh out the stubbed directives (`[Origin]`, `[Namespace]`, `[Export]`).
    4.  Implement the granular import syntax.

*   **P3: Complete CHTL JS Parser:**
    1.  With a functional scanner providing clean CHTL JS input, implement the full parsing logic for `Animate`, `Router`, `Delegate`, and the event binding operator (`&->`).
    2.  Refactor the parser to handle nested CHTL JS constructs, which will now be possible.

*   **P4: Testing and Integration:**
    1.  Create dedicated tests for all the newly implemented features, especially for the Unified Scanner.
    2.  Perform end-to-end integration tests to ensure the entire pipeline (Scanner -> CHTL Compiler -> CHTL JS Compiler -> Code Merger) works as specified in `CHTL.md`.
